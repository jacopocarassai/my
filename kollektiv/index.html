<h2>Data Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Our website  may be used without entering personal information. Different rules may apply to  certain services on our site, however, and are explained separately below. We  collect personal information from you (e.g. name, address, email address,  telephone number, etc.) in accordance with the provisions of German data  protection statutes. Information is considered personal if it can be associated  exclusively to a specific natural person. The legal framework for data  protection may be found in the German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) and the  Telemedia Act (TMG). The provisions below serve to provide information as to  the manner, extent and purpose for collecting, using and processing personal  information by the provider.</p>
<p> <strong>Robert Zimmermann</strong><br>
<strong>Pücklerstrasse 19</strong><br>  
<strong>10997 BERLIN</strong></p>
<strong><a href="mailto:mort_is@web.de">mort_is@web.de</a></strong></p>
<p>    Please be  aware that data transfer via the internet is subject to security risks and,  therefore, complete protection against third-party access to transferred data  cannot be ensured.</p>

<h4>Server Data</h4>
<p>For  technical reasons, data such as the following, which your internet browser  transmits to us or to our web space provider (so called server log files), is  collected:

            - type and version of the browser you use
            - operating system
            - websites that linked you to our site (referrer URL)
            - websites that you visit
            - date and time of your visit
            - your Internet Protocol (IP) address.

            This anonymous data is stored separately from any personal information you may  have provided, thereby making it impossible to connect it to any particular  person. The data is used for statistical purposes in order to improve our  website and services.</p>

<h4>Newsletter</h4>
<p>Our website  offers you the opportunity to subscribe to our newsletter. The newsletter  provides you periodically with information about our services. To receive our  newsletter, we require a valid email address. We will review the email address  you provide for the purpose of determining whether you are in fact the owner of  the email address provided or whether the actual owner of said address is  authorized to receive the newsletter. When subscribing to our newsletter, we  will store your IP address as well as the date and time you subscribed. This  serves to protect us in the event a third party improperly and without your  knowledge makes use of your email address to subscribe to our newsletter. We  will not collect any other data. The data thereby collected is used solely for  the purpose of receiving our newsletter. No data is transferred to third  parties. Nor is any of this information matched to any information that other  components of our website may collect. You may cancel your subscription to the  newsletter at any time. You will find additional details in the email  confirming your subscription as well as in each newsletter.</p>

<h4>Contacting Us</h4>
<p>On our  website we offer you the opportunity to contact us, either by email and/or by  using a contact form. In such event, information provided by the user is stored  for the purpose of facilitating communications with the user. No data is  transferred to third parties. Nor is any of this information matched to any  information that may be collected by other components of our website.</p>

<h4>Use of Google Analytics with anonymization</h4>
<p>Our website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service from Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA, hereinafter referred to as “Google“. Google Analytics employs so-called “cookies“, text files that are stored to your computer in order to facilitate an analysis of your use of the site.</p>
<p>The information generated by these cookies, such as time, place and frequency of your visits to our site, including your IP address, is transmitted to Google’s location in the US and stored there.</p>
<p>We use Google Analytics with an IP anonymization feature on our website. In doing so, Google abbreviates and thereby anonymizes your IP address before transferring it from member states of the European Union or signatory states to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.</p>
<p>Google will use this information to evaluate your usage of our site, to compile reports on website activity for us, and to provide other services related to website-&nbsp;and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties if this is required by law or to the extent this data is processed by third parties&nbsp;on Google´s behalf.</p>
<p>Google states that it will in never associate your IP address with other data held by Google. You can prevent cookies from being installed by adjusting the settings on your browser software accordingly. You should be aware, however, that by doing so you may not be able to make full use of all the functions of our website.</p>
<p>Google also offers a disabling option for the most common browsers, thus providing you with greater control over&nbsp;the data which is collected and processed by Google. If you enable this option, no information regarding your website visit is transmitted to Google Analytics. However, the activation does not prevent the transmission of information to us or to any other web analytics services we may use. For more information about the disabling option provided by Google, and how to enable this option, visit <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en</a></p>

<h4>Use of reCAPTCHA</h4>
<p>In order to protect input forms on our site, we use the “reCAPTCHA” service of Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA, hereinafter "Google." By means of this service it can be distinguished whether the corresponding input is of human origin or is created improperly by automated machine processing.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, the referrer URL, the IP address, the behaviour of the website visitors, information about the operating system, browser and length of stay, cookies, display instructions and scripts, user input behaviour and mouse movements in the “reCAPTCHA” checkbox are conveyed to “Google.”</p>
<p>Google uses the information obtained, among other things, to digitize books and other printed matter as well as to optimize services such as Google Street View and Google Maps (e.g. house number and street name recognition).</p>
<p>The IP address provided as part of “reCAPTCHA” is not merged with other data from Google unless you are logged into your Google Account at the time the "reCAPTCHA" plug-in is used. If you want to prevent this transmission and storage of data by “Google” about you and your behaviour on our website, you must log out of “Google” before you visit our site or before using the reCAPTCHA plug-in.</p>
<p>The use of the “reCAPTCHA” service is according to the Google Terms of Use:&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Use of MailChimp</h4>
<h5>Newsletter Consent</h5>
<p>You will be asked to consent to the use of your personal data to receive our newsletter as follows:&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I have read the privacy policy and I give my consent to data being processed by a service provider located in the United States”.</p>
<p>We use the newsletter to provide you with regular updates about our offers. To receive our newsletter, you will need a valid email address. We will then check the email address entered to ensure that you are actually its owner or if its owner has agreed to receive our newsletter. By registering for the newsletter, we will save your IP address and date and time of registration. This will be used in case a third party misuses your email address to subscribe to our newsletter without your knowledge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will not compare the data collected during newsletter registration with any other data that might be collected by other components of our site.&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Newsletter by MailChimp&nbsp;</h5>
<p>We use <strong>MailChimp</strong> to send our newsletter to our subscribers. <strong>MailChimp</strong> is a service provided by The Rocket Science Group, LLC, 512 Means Street, Suite 404, Atlanta, GA 30318, USA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The data stored when you registered for the newsletter (email address, name, IP address, and time and date of registration) will be sent to a server operated by The Rocket Science Group in the United States and stored there in accordance with the EU-US Privacy Shield.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Further information about the data protection offered by <strong>MailChimp</strong> can be found at:&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/</a></p>
<p>Further information about the EU-US Privacy Shield can be found at:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Europa_International/International/Artikel/EU-US_PrivacyShield_Daten%C3%BCbermittlungenUSA.html?nn=5217040" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Die Bundesbeauftragte für den Datenschutz und die Informationsfreiheit</a></p>

<p>You may cancel your newsletter subscription and revoke your consent to the storage of this data at any time with future effect. For instructions to take this step, please refer to the confirmation email and each newsletter.</p>
<h5>Newsletter tracking</h5>
<p>Our newsletter includes so-called web bugs that allow us to recognise if and when an email has been opened and which links in the email have been clicked by its recipient.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This data is stored by us so that we can best align our newsletter to the wishes and interests of our subscribers. Accordingly, the data thus collected is used to send personalised newsletters to each recipient. &nbsp;</p>
<p>You will be asked to consent to the use of your personal data as follows:</p>
<p>“I agree that my data and my user responses will be stored electronically by newsletter tracking so that I can receive a personalised newsletter. The revocation of the consent to receive the newsletter constitutes a revocation of the consent for the tracking described above.”</p>
<p>By revoking the consent to receive the newsletter, the consent to the aforementioned tracking is revoked.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Information/Cancellation/Deletion</h3>
<p>On the basis  of the Federal Data Protection Act, you may contact us at no cost if you have  questions relating to the collection, processing or use of your personal  information, if you wish to request the correction, blocking or deletion of the  same, or if you wish to cancel explicitly granted consent. Please note that you  have the right to have incorrect data corrected or to have personal data  deleted, where such claim is not barred by any legal obligation to retain this  data.</p>
